- order statistics query algorithm
- query points
- rand select()
- rand partition()

1. read the IDs, addresses, lat., long., of each store location
and save it in an ArrayList
    read in cvs files of whataburger
    read in cvs files of starbucks

2. Compute the distance of the query point to each of the different stores using the Haversine Formula

3. Store these distances into an array


- implement the Rand-Select() algorithm
- implement the Rand-Partition() algorithm

- there is a seperate file that containt the query points:
(the current location of the mobile user)^


- Use the order statistic query to find the farthest store from the query that we care about.
